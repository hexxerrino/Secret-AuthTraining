# Secret-AuthTraining
This app is part of the first course I took on web dev. It was the first project I made that included authentication.
To create the app I use NODEJS EXPRESS MongoDB database and for authentication I use passport middleware.
And yes I know my app.js is a disaster and that you shouldn't have everything in one file but I decided to leave it like that becuase it shows the learning process better.
